# TGraph Bot Configuration File - Nested Structure
# ============================================================================
# 
# This file contains all configuration options for the TGraph Discord bot.
# 
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to data/config/config.yml
# 2. Configure the Services section below (Essential Settings)
# 3. Adjust other settings as needed for your use case
# 
# The application will look for the configuration file in data/config/config.yml by default.
