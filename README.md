- See [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colors.html) for more options. 

### Annotation Options

- `ANNOTATE_DAILY_PLAY_COUNT`: Enable/disable annotations on daily play count graph (default is true)
- `ANNOTATE_PLAY_COUNT_BY_DAYOFWEEK`: Enable/disable annotations on play count by day of week graph (default is true)

- `MY_STATS_GLOBAL_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`: The global cooldown period in seconds between any two uses of the `/my_stats` command (default is 60 seconds)

## Slash Commands

TGraph Bot supports the following slash commands:

- `/about`: Displays information about the bot, including its description, GitHub repository, and license.
- `/update_graphs`: Manually triggers the bot to update and post the graphs.
- `/uptime`: Shows how long the bot has been running.
- `/config`: Allows viewing or editing the bot's configuration.
  - Usage: `/config <action> [key] [value]`
  - Actions:
    - `view`: Shows all configuration options or a specific key if provided.
    - `edit`: Edits a specific configuration key with the provided value.
- `/my_stats`: Generates and sends personalized graphs based on the user's Tautulli data.
  - Usage: `/my_stats <email>`
  - This command generates graphs specific to the user and sends them via direct message.
  - The `<email>` parameter should match the email associated with the user's Plex account in Tautulli.

To use these commands, simply type them in any channel where the bot is present. The bot will respond with the requested information or action.

Note: The `/config` command responses are only visible to the user who issued the command to protect sensitive information. The `/my_stats` command sends the graphs via direct message to ensure user privacy.

### Rate Limiting

The `/my_stats` command is subject to rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- There's a cooldown period for each user after using the command.
- There's also a global cooldown that affects all users.

If a user attempts to use the command too frequently, they will receive a message indicating when they can use the command again.

## Managing Bot Permissions

TGraph Bot uses Discord's built-in Integrations system for managing command permissions and includes an automatic permission checker. This allows server administrators to control access to sensitive commands like `/config` and `/update_graphs` directly through Discord's interface, while also providing insights into the current permission setup. Here's how it works:

1. **Automatic Permission Checking**:
   - Upon startup, the bot checks and logs the current permission settings for all commands across all servers it's in.
   - This helps identify any potential security risks, such as sensitive commands being accessible to all users.
   - It looks like this: [Preview Image](https://i.imgur.com/VIzl1ne.png)

2. **Permission Reports**:
   - The bot generates detailed reports of command permissions, which are logged to the console and logfile.
   - These reports show which roles or users have access to each command, helping to ensure proper access control.

3. **Setting Up Permissions**:
   - Access your Discord server settings and navigate to the Integrations section.
   - Find TGraph Bot in the list and click to expand its settings.
   - In the "Command Permissions" section, you can specify which roles or users have permission to use each command.
   - It's recommended to restrict sensitive commands like `/config`, `/my_stats` and `/update_graphs` to trusted roles only.

**Note:** If no specific permissions are set for a command, it will be accessible to all users who can see and use slash commands in the server. Always ensure sensitive commands are properly restricted.

## Language Support

Tautulli Graph Bot supports multiple languages using i18n. The available languages are defined in the `i18n` directory, with separate YAML files for each language:

- `en.yml`: English language translations
- `da.yml`: Danish language translations

To set the language for the bot, update the `LANGUAGE` value in the `config.yml` file to the desired language code (`en` for English or `da` for Danish).

## Creating a Discord Bot

To post messages to Discord, you need to create a bot and obtain its token.

1. **Open the Discord Developer Portal:** Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

    - Under the `Token` section, click `Copy` to copy your bot token.
    - Use this token as the value for `DISCORD_TOKEN` in your `config.yml` file.

5. **Invite Your Bot to Your Server:**
    - Go to the `OAuth2` section.
    - Under `OAuth2 URL Generator`, select `bot` under `SCOPES` and the following permissions under `BOT PERMISSIONS`:
        - Read Messages/View Channels
        - Send Messages
        - Embed Links
