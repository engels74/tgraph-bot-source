"""
Graph manager for TGraph Bot.

This module acts as the central orchestrator for server-wide graph generation.
It uses the GraphFactory to create graph instances, fetches data via DataFetcher,
and triggers generation. Crucially, it runs the blocking Matplotlib/Seaborn graph
creation code in a separate thread using asyncio.to_thread() to prevent freezing
the bot's event loop.
