      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the configuration system implementation into subtasks covering: 1) directory structure setup, 2) Pydantic schema implementation, 3) YAML configuration manager with atomic saving, and 4) sample configuration generation with documentation",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components including directory structure creation, Pydantic model implementation, YAML configuration management with atomic operations, and comprehensive documentation. The cyclomatic complexity will be moderate due to configuration parsing logic and validation handling."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the i18n implementation into subtasks for: 1) gettext integration and translation function implementation, 2) locale directory structure and initial translation files setup, and 3) Weblate integration and string extraction utilities",
      "reasoning": "The i18n framework requires understanding of gettext, translation file structures, and Weblate integration. While conceptually straightforward, proper implementation requires careful attention to string extraction, formatting with variables, and fallback mechanisms."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Discord bot framework implementation into: 1) main entry point with initialization logic, 2) extension management system, 3) Discord connection and event handling, 4) error handling and logging implementation, and 5) graceful shutdown mechanisms",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex async patterns with discord.py, extension management, error handling across multiple systems, and proper event loop management. The integration points between configuration, i18n, and Discord API increase the overall complexity."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Tautulli API integration into: 1) async httpx client implementation, 2) error handling and retry mechanisms, 3) caching system for API responses, and 4) specific data fetching functions for different statistics types",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing async HTTP requests with comprehensive error handling, retry logic with exponential backoff, and caching mechanisms. The variety of data types to fetch and process adds to the complexity."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the base graph system into: 1) abstract base class implementation with common interface methods, 2) graph factory pattern implementation, and 3) utility functions for graph operations and formatting",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating an abstract foundation using OOP principles and factory pattern design. While conceptually complex, the implementation is focused on establishing patterns rather than complex algorithms."

      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing six different graph types, each with unique data processing, visualization requirements, and customization options. The complexity comes from handling various data transformations and creating aesthetically pleasing visualizations with Seaborn."

      "reasoning": "This task involves complex async patterns with thread management, coordination between multiple components (GraphFactory, DataFetcher), and ensuring non-blocking execution of CPU-bound operations. The performance considerations and resource management add significant complexity."
