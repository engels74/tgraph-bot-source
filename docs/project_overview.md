-   **README.md:** Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage examples, and other relevant documentation.
-   **pyproject.toml:** The standardized project definition file. It contains metadata, lists dependencies (like `discord.py`, `pydantic`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `httpx`), and configures tools like `pytest`. It makes the project installable (e.g., via `pip install -e .`).
-   **i18n.py:** Handles internationalization (i18n) by loading gettext translation files from the `locale` directory and providing functions to retrieve translated strings based on the configured language.
-   **main.py:** The main entry point for the bot. Initializes the bot, loads configuration and translations, sets up logging, loads extensions (commands), manages the main event loop, background tasks (like scheduled graph updates), and handles overall bot lifecycle and error management.
-   **.weblate:** Configuration file for Weblate integration, defining project settings, components, and file paths.

---

##### `bot/` Module

-   **bot/\_\_init\_\_.py:** Marks the `bot` directory as a Python package.
-   **bot/extensions.py:** Contains utility functions for managing (loading, unloading, reloading) the bot's command extensions (Cogs).
-   **bot/permission_checker.py:** Handles checking and logging Discord command permissions for the bot across all guilds it's in, ensuring commands have appropriate access controls.
-   **bot/update_tracker.py:** Manages the scheduling and tracking of when the server-wide graphs should be automatically updated, based on configuration (`UPDATE_DAYS`, `FIXED_UPDATE_TIME`).

---

##### `bot/commands/` Submodule

-   **bot/commands/\_\_init\_\_.py:** Initializes the `commands` package, importing and making available all the command Cogs (AboutCog, ConfigCog, etc.).
-   **bot/commands/about.py:** Defines the `/about` slash command, which displays information about the bot (description, GitHub link, license).
-   **bot/commands/config.py:** Defines the `/config` slash command group (`/config view`, `/config edit`) for viewing and modifying bot configuration settings.
-   **bot/commands/my_stats.py:** Defines the `/my_stats` slash command, allowing users to request their personal Plex statistics (graphs) via DM by providing their Plex email.
-   **bot/commands/update_graphs.py:** Defines the `/update_graphs` slash command, allowing administrators to manually trigger the regeneration and posting of server-wide statistics graphs.
-   **bot/commands/uptime.py:** Defines the `/uptime` slash command, which displays how long the bot has been running since its last start.

---

##### `config/` Module

-   **config/\_\_init\_\_.py:** Exposes the main configuration object to the rest of the application, making it easy to import and access settings.
-   **config/manager.py:** The core of the configuration system. It handles loading the `config.yml` file, parsing it into the Pydantic `Settings` model defined in `schema.py`, saving changes back to the file atomically (preserving comments), and managing the live configuration state.
-   **config/schema.py:** Defines the application's configuration structure using a Pydantic `BaseModel`. This single file is the source of truth for all settings, their types, default values, and validation rules (e.g., using `Field` validators for value ranges or formats).
-   **config/config.yml.sample:** A sample configuration file showing the expected structure, keys, and example values for the `config.yml` file that the user needs to create.

---

##### `graphs/` Module

-   **graphs/graph_manager.py:** Acts as the central orchestrator for server-wide graph generation. It uses the `GraphFactory` to create graph instances, fetches data via `DataFetcher`, and triggers generation. **Crucially, it runs the blocking Matplotlib/Seaborn graph creation code in a separate thread using `asyncio.to_thread()` to prevent freezing the bot's event loop.** It then posts the resulting images to Discord and manages old messages.
-   **graphs/user_graph_manager.py:** Handles graph generation for the `/my_stats` command. Like the main manager, **it uses `asyncio.to_thread()` to execute the CPU-bound graph generation**, ensuring the bot remains responsive while creating personalized graphs for a user.

---

##### `graphs/graph_modules/` Submodule

-   **graphs/graph_modules/\_\_init\_\_.py:** Marks the `graph_modules` directory as a Python package.
-   **graphs/graph_modules/base_graph.py:** An abstract base class defining the common interface for all graph types. It uses Matplotlib to handle the core figure and axes setup (e.g., size, background color, titles), providing a canvas for the high-level Seaborn library to draw onto.
-   **graphs/graph_modules/data_fetcher.py:** Responsible for fetching data from the Tautulli API. **It exclusively uses a modern, async-native HTTP client like `httpx` to perform all API requests**, ensuring that no I/O operations block the bot's event loop. It includes robust error handling for API timeouts, connection issues, and invalid responses, as well as caching results.
-   **graphs/graph_modules/graph_factory.py:** A factory class that creates instances of specific graph classes based on the enabled settings in the configuration.
-   **graphs/graph_modules/daily_play_count_graph.py:** Inherits from `BaseGraph` and uses the **Seaborn** library to implement the logic to plot daily play counts. This approach simplifies the plotting code and produces a more aesthetically pleasing result.

#### Python 3.13 Best Practices

The project employs several modern Python techniques, including:

-   **Type Hints and Pydantic:** Every function includes type annotations, and Pydantic models are used for configuration, ensuring data integrity and clarity.
-   **High-Level Libraries:** Uses libraries like **Seaborn** to produce better results with less, more readable code.
-   **Match Statements:** Used for streamlined control flow in command processing and data handling.
-   **Async/Await:** Leverages asynchronous programming with `discord.py` and `httpx` to handle all I/O without blocking.
-   **Non-Blocking Execution:** CPU-bound tasks like graph generation are properly delegated to separate threads to keep the bot responsive.

---

#### Test-Driven Development Approach

The project is built using a test-driven development (TDD) methodology:

1.  **Write tests first:** Tests defined with `pytest` specify the expected behavior.
2.  **Observe failing tests:** Confirming that the features have not yet been implemented.
3.  **Implement the features:** Code is then written to make tests pass.
4.  **Refactor:** After passing tests, code quality is improved while ensuring all tests continue to succeed.

---

#### Internationalization and Weblate Integration

The bot's internationalization system follows Weblate best practices, using the GNU gettext format, automated string extraction, and CI validation to ensure high-quality, continuous localization.
