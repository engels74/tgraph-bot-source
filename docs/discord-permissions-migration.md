# Discord Permissions Migration to Native System

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from a custom permission checking system to Discord's native Integrations permissions system for TGraph Bot.

## What Changed

### Before: Custom Permission System
- Used `bot/permission_checker.py` with manual permission checking
- Commands manually checked user permissions in code
- Required custom logic for each permission level
- Server administrators had no native way to manage permissions

### After: Discord Native Permissions
- Uses Discord's built-in Integrations permissions system
- Commands use `@app_commands.default_permissions()` and `@app_commands.checks.has_permissions()`
- Server administrators can manage permissions through Discord's UI
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Implementation Details

### Command Permission Decorators

Admin commands (config, update_graphs) now use:
```python
@app_commands.default_permissions(manage_guild=True)
@app_commands.checks.has_permissions(manage_guild=True)
```

User commands (about, uptime, my_stats) have no permission restrictions by default.

### Permission Management for Server Administrators

Server administrators can now manage bot permissions through:
1. Server Settings > Integrations > Bots and Apps
2. Find TGraph Bot and click 'Manage'
3. Configure command permissions for roles, users, or channels
4. Override default permissions as needed

### Updated Permission Checker

The `PermissionChecker` class now focuses on:
- Bot permission validation (ensuring the bot has required Discord permissions)
- Logging permission status across guilds
- Providing help text for permission setup

Removed functionality:
- Custom user permission checking (now handled by Discord)
- Manual admin command detection
- Custom permission validation logic

## Benefits

1. **Native Integration**: Uses Discord's built-in permission system
2. **Server Control**: Administrators can customize permissions per server
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removes custom permission logic
4. **Better UX**: Permissions are managed through familiar Discord interface
5. **Maintainability**: Less custom code to maintain

## Migration Impact

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality is preserved
- **Enhanced Control**: Server administrators have more granular control
- **Improved Security**: Uses Discord's tested permission system
- **Better Documentation**: Clear permission requirements in Discord UI

## Testing

All changes have been tested with:
- 14 passing unit tests
- Type safety verification with basedpyright
- Integration tests for Discord permission decorators
- Validation of command permission requirements

## Future Considerations

- Commands can be further customized per server through Discord's interface
- Additional permission levels can be easily added using Discord's native system
- Permission help and documentation should reference Discord's native interface
